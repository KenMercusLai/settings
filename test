**Acidity**(酸度)
– The sharp lively quality characteristic of high-grown coffee, tasted mainly at the tip of the tongue. The brisk, snappy  quality that makes coffee refreshing. It is NOT the same as bitter or sour and  has nothing to do with pH factors. Coffees are low in acidity, between 5 and 6 on the pH scale.

**Americano**(美式咖啡) – A shot or two of espresso that has been poured into a cup, which is then filled with hot water.

**Aroma**(香气) 
– The fragrance of brewed coffee. The smell of coffee grounds is referred to as the Bouquet.
冲泡咖啡的香味。咖啡渣的气味被称为“花束”

**Barista** 
– A person who makes coffee drinks as a profession.

**Bitter**(味苦)
– The taste perceived at the back of the tongue. Dark Roasts are intentionally bitter. Over-extraction (too little coffee at too fine a grind) can cause a bad bitterness.

**Bland**(平淡味)
– The pale flavour often found in low grown robusta coffees. Also caused by under-extraction (too little coffee or too course a grind).

**Blend**(混合) 
– A mixture of two or more individual varietals of coffee.

**Body** 
– The tactile impression of the weight of the coffee in the mouth. May range from thin to medium to full to buttery to syrupy.
口中咖啡重量的触感。可以从薄到中到满到黄油到糖浆

**Briny**(咸的) 
– The salty sensation caused by excessive heat after brewing (truck-stop coffee).
冲泡后过热引起的咸感

**Caffè Mocha** 
– This can be prepared a variety of ways. Basically this is a chocolate Caffè latte. Often prepared with whipped cream on top.

**Cappuccino** 
– A shot or two of espresso poured into a cup which is then filled with half steamed milk and half foam milk so that it is one third coffee, one third milk and one third milk foam.

**Cupping**(品咖啡)
– While tasting wine is called “tasting”, tasting coffee is called “cupping”.

**Demitasse –**(小型咖啡杯) 
 – A small cup used for serving espresso. It is a French term meaning ‘half cup’.

**Doppio**(双倍)
– A double shot of espresso. Also see solo.

**Caffeine** 
– The drug contained in coffee. A bitter white alkaloid derived from coffee (or tea) and used in medicine for a mild stimulant or to treat certain kinds of headache. Found in very small quantities in the coffee beans. Soluble in water and alcohol.

**Crema** (是指意式浓缩咖啡表面的深红褐色的泡沫)
–The caramel coloured foam that appears on top of a shot of espresso during the brewing period. It should remain for at least one minute. If your Crema is gone then you waited too long…or you received a bad shot! The crema makes a ‘cap’ which helps retain the aromatics and flavors of the espresso within the cup – the presence of crema indicates an acceptable brew… Crema is due to colloids and lipids forced out into an emulsion under the pressure of an espresso machine.
焦糖色的泡沫:在冲泡过程中出现在浓缩咖啡上的焦糖色泡沫它至少要保持一分钟。如果你的Crema没有了，那么你等待的时间太长了，或者你收到了一个糟糕的射击! crema是指在浓缩咖啡机的压力下，胶体和脂质被挤出成乳剂。

**Earthy**(泥土的芳香) 
– The spicy “of the earth taste” of Indonesian coffees.
印尼咖啡的辛辣味道

**Espresso** 
– A brewing method that extracts the heart of the bean. It was invented in Italy at the turn of the century. A pump-driven machine forces hot water through fine grounds at around nine atmospheres of pressure. It should take between 18 to 23 seconds to extract a good shot. This will produce from 3/4 to one ounce of great liquid. This produces a sweet, thick and rich, smooth shot of espresso.
一种提取咖啡豆核心的酿造方法。它是在世纪之交的意大利发明的。一台水泵驱动的机器将热水以大约9个大气压的压力通过细地层.大概需要18到23秒才能打出一枪。这将产生3/4到1盎司的优质液体。这样可以产生一种香甜、浓稠、醇厚、顺滑的浓咖啡。


**Espresso Lungo** – A shot that is pulled long for a bit of extra espresso. While many believe this maximizes the Caffèine, in most shops this merely produces a bitter cup. (Sometimes because of overextraction.)

**Espresso Macchiato** – Espresso with a minimal amount (or “mark”) of steamed milk on top.

**Espresso Ristretto** – Literally “restricted” espresso. A shorter draw. The goal being a thicker and more flavourful espresso.

**Exotic** – Unusual aromatic and flavor notes, such as berry or floral.

**Flavour** – The total impression of Aroma, Acidity and Body.

**French Press** – A device for making coffee in which ground coffee is steeped in water. The grounds are then removed from the coffee by means of a filter plunger which presses the grounds to the bottom of the pot. Also referred to as plunger pot, or cafetiere.

**Froth or Foam**(发泡)
– Milk which has been made thick and foamy by aerating it with hot steam.
用热蒸汽使牛奶变稠，产生泡沫.

**Hard Bean** – Coffee grown at relatively high altitudes, 4,000 to 4,500 feet. Coffee grown above 4,500 feet is referred to as strictly hard bean. This terminology says that beans grown at higher altitudes mature more slowly and are harder and denser than other beans and are thus more desirable.

**Latte** – Prepared by pouring milk into the espresso.

**Peaberry** 
– Normally, each coffee cherry contains two beans. Occasionally, a cherry will form with only one bean. These are called  peaberries and are frequently separated and sold as its own distinct varietal. New Guinea is one of the more popular ones.
通常情况下，每个咖啡樱桃含有两颗豆子。有时，只有一颗豆子就能形成一个樱桃。这些被称为peaberries，经常被分离出来作为自己独特的品种出售。新几内亚是比较受欢迎的一个。

**Portafilter** (手柄)
– The cupped handle on an espresso machine which holds the finely ground coffee during the brewing process.

**Solo** 
– A single shot of espresso. Also see doppio.
一杯浓缩咖啡，也是双倍的量（？）

**Soft Bean** 
– Describes coffee grown at relatively low altitudes (under 4,000 ft). Beans grown at lower altitudes mature more quickly and produce a lighter, more porous bean.

**Spicy** – The flavour of particular spices.

**Sweet** – Smooth and palatable coffee that is free from defects and harsh flavors.

**Tone** – The appearance or colour of coffee. Usually in three tones – light, medium and dark.

**Varietal** – The term used for the coffee that comes from a geographical region. A Sumatra, Kenya, Costa Rica or a Java are varietals. As in wine, soil, climate and cultivation methods affect the taste of your coffee. The term varietal is actually a misnomer, since Arabica coffee plants are basically of the same species, unlike wine grapes, which come from different species of grape vines.

**Winy** – A flavor reminiscent of fine red wine. Kenya AA coffee is one of the most notables.
